# VEN UI

React + TypeScript SPA (Vite build, nginx-served, port 8214) — the per-site dashboard for
[[openadr-lab]]'s VEN containers (docs/history/project_journal.md §6).

## Structure

- `src/api/client.ts` — `VenApi` fetch wrapper; `src/api/hooks.ts` — react-query hooks
  with `refetchInterval` polling; `src/api/types.ts` — pass-through DTO types
  ([[dto-pass-through]]).
- `VenContext` — multi-VEN selector switching all pages across the three instances.
- Pages: Dashboard, Programs, Events, Sensors; plus the planner timeline views exercised
  by `tests/features/ven_ui_planner.feature` and `ven_timeline.feature`.
- Phase 4 additions: `NotificationsBell` in the app bar (badge + feed panel, 10 s
  polling — the UI face of [[notifications]]); a `ComfortCurveCard` on the Devices
  page (per-asset fill%/bid table, POST installs an override, Reset restores the
  built-in default — WP4.2/BL-19); the EV/heater/shiftable dialogs gained a
  request-mode select (`ModeSelect`, native `<select>` for testability) and the EV
  dialog a budget field shown only for `MAX_COST` (WP4.1/BL-28).

## Timeline specifics

The timeline renders the plan produced by the [[milp-planner]] including its variable-step
zones ([[three-tier-plan-grid]]): zone shading uses per-zone opacity (fixed at 7edeb08 so
Zone A is not invisible), and a **now-point** marker shows the live simulator value at the
exact request time — deliberately *not* snapped to the plan grid
(docs/architecture/ven_milp_planner.md §2.2, timeline now-point).

`GET /timeline/:asset_id` and `/timeline/all` (`VEN/src/routes/timeline.rs`,
`VEN/src/controller/timeline.rs`) serve the chart data. The **future/forecast segment**
returns one real point per real plan slot at its native per-zone step size (5/10/15 min,
`build_asset_timeline`) — it is no longer resampled onto a fixed-width grid with
time-weighted averaging. That resampling used to blend real slot values into synthetic
buckets and desynchronise the displayed timestamp from any real planning decision
whenever the bucket width didn't line up with a zone's step size (routine in the
expanded 48 h view). The **history segment** is still grid-resampled at a fixed
resolution, since it has no natural "slot" structure to preserve. The frontend needed no
change: recharts' existing tooltip snap already reads real `ts` values from the data
array, so it now snaps to real plan-slot boundaries instead of fake grid buckets.

Testing: Vitest + React Testing Library component tests, `data-testid`/`aria` attributes
per `docs/guidelines/REACT_GUIDELINES.md`; part of suite 1 in [[testing-strategy]].

## History page

Phase 1 added a `History` page (`VEN/ui/src/pages/History.tsx`) that queries the new
`GET /history/*` routes and reuses the existing `AssetTimelineChart`/`TariffChart`
components rather than introducing new chart code. It is a distinct concern from the
live/forecast timeline above: History shows the durably-persisted operational record
(ticks, grid samples, plan snapshots, events, reports), backed by the VEN-local SQLite
store described in [[history-store]], not the in-memory simulator ring buffers.
