# Specification Quality Checklist: VEN Simulator Reform

**Purpose**: Validate specification completeness and quality before proceeding to planning
**Created**: 2026-03-15
**Feature**: [spec.md](../spec.md)

## Content Quality

- [x] No implementation details (languages, frameworks, APIs)
- [x] Focused on user value and business needs
- [x] Written for non-technical stakeholders
- [x] All mandatory sections completed

## Requirement Completeness

- [x] No [NEEDS CLARIFICATION] markers remain
- [x] Requirements are testable and unambiguous
- [x] Success criteria are measurable
- [x] Success criteria are technology-agnostic (no implementation details)
- [x] All acceptance scenarios are defined
- [x] Edge cases are identified
- [x] Scope is clearly bounded
- [x] Dependencies and assumptions identified

## Feature Readiness

- [x] All functional requirements have clear acceptance criteria
- [x] User scenarios cover primary flows
- [x] Feature meets measurable outcomes defined in Success Criteria
- [x] No implementation details leak into specification

## Notes

All checklist items pass. Spec is ready for `/speckit.plan`.

Key scope boundaries confirmed in Assumptions section:
- `reactor/` and controller dispatcher/monitor are explicitly out of scope
- `AssetHistoryBuffer` data structure is added but not wired (wiring is speckit 2)
- `GET /sim/schema` endpoint is added but no UI consumes it (UI is speckit 3)
- Stub removal is limited to the three initialization stubs only; force fields remain
