# Implementation Plan: MILP Asset Port — Decouple Planner from Concrete Asset Types

**Branch**: `020-milp-asset-port` | **Date**: 2026-05-10 | **Spec**: [spec.md](spec.md)

## Summary

Introduce the `AssetMilpContext` port trait and `AssetKind` discriminant into the VEN MILP planner to eliminate all direct imports of `Battery`, `EvCharger`, and `Heater` from `controller/milp/` and `controller/milp_interactions.rs`. Both the constraint-builder (solver files) and the cross-asset interaction module will receive `Vec<Box<dyn AssetMilpContext>>` instead of concrete types. As part of this, the LP variable handle types (`*MilpVars`) are relocated from `assets/` to `controller/milp_interactions.rs`, and three new `#[cfg(test)]` blocks (one per concrete asset implementation) are added, plus a new n=48 medium regression test profile.

## Technical Context

**Language/Version**: Rust stable (2021 edition)  
**Primary Dependencies**: `good_lp` (HiGHS MILP solver), `tokio`, `axum`, `serde`, `chrono`  
**Storage**: N/A — no persistence changes  
**Testing**: `cargo test` — `#[cfg(test)]` blocks in `controller/milp/` and `assets/`; existing BDD suite as regression safety net  
**Target Platform**: Linux ARM64 (Raspberry Pi 4), Docker Compose v2  
**Project Type**: Embedded library (VEN backend service)  
**Performance Goals**: MILP solve time unchanged (10–24 s on Pi4 for n=288); new n=48 regression test must complete in < 5 s  
**Constraints**: 500-line file limit per Constitution VI; no `use crate::assets::` in any file under `VEN/src/controller/milp/`; no `use crate::profile::` in any file under `VEN/src/controller/` or `VEN/src/entities/`  
**Scale/Scope**: 3 concrete asset implementations (Battery, EV, Heater); 1 cross-asset interaction (BatEvCoexist)

## Constitution Check

*GATE: Must pass before Phase 0 research. Re-check after Phase 1 design.*

| Principle | Status | Notes |
|-----------|--------|-------|
| I — OpenADR Spec Fidelity | ✅ N/A | Internal Rust refactoring; no OpenADR field names involved |
| II — BDD-First Testing | ✅ Pass | No new behaviour introduced; existing 232 BDD scenarios are the regression gate. New unit tests added for newly exposed test surface (Constitution VI mandate) |
| III — Upstream Compatibility | ✅ N/A | VEN backend only; not a submodule change |
| IV — Lean Architecture | ✅ Justified | `AssetMilpContext` trait is explicitly mandated by Constitution VI and the refactoring plan. Not speculative — the concrete need (adding an asset without touching two planner files) is stated in FR-001 |
| V — Infrastructure Parity | ✅ Pass | No Docker Compose or config changes |
| VI — VEN Hexagonal Architecture | ✅ This phase directly satisfies the mandate: `milp_planner` and `milp_interactions` MUST accept `Vec<Box<dyn AssetMilpContext>>`; direct imports of `A_BAT`, `A_EV`, `A_HTR` prohibited. Post-phase verifiable invariant must pass: `grep -r "use crate::assets::" VEN/src/controller/milp → empty` |

**Post-Phase 1 re-check**: Pass — contracts and data model confirm no constitution violations.

## Complexity Tracking

*Required by Constitution IV: every non-trivial abstraction must be justified here before introduction.*

| Abstraction | Justification | Constitution Reference |
|-------------|---------------|----------------------|
| `AssetMilpContext` trait (port) | Directly mandated to remediate AB-02: `milp_planner` and `milp_interactions` MUST accept `Vec<Box<dyn AssetMilpContext>>`; direct imports of `A_BAT`, `A_EV`, `A_HTR` prohibited | Constitution VI |
| `AssetKind` enum | Required by the port contract for pool-slot dispatch and structured logging without concrete type imports | Constitution VI |
| `AssetMilpParams` enum | Carries scalar parameters to `build_milp_inputs()`; replaces direct asset-type construction in `inputs.rs` without introducing a DTO layer | Constitution IV (no DTO normalisation) |
| Mock adapters in `services/test_support/` | Mandated test infrastructure: mock adapters MUST live in `VEN/src/services/test_support/`, compiled in all builds (not `#[cfg(test)]`), to be shareable across service test modules | Constitution VI |

**Structure Decision**: Single Rust workspace, VEN backend only. No new top-level directories. The `asset_port.rs` file is added inside the existing `controller/milp/` sub-module.
